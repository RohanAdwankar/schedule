```
This was a simple project to learn Rust.
I may continue to build a more comprehensive task management application in Rust.
I use this by compiling the executable and adding it to PATH.
Then I use these aliases.
alias week='schedule thisWeek'
alias month='schedule thisMonth'
alias weeks='schedule'
```
